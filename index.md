## The Problem
Currently, there are a wealth of resources for learning new instruments and uploading music online on an individual basis. While this is certainly something to be celebrated, there are no resources for musicians to connect with, learn from, inspire, and motivate each other. There are thousands of artists that want to collaborate with others but don’t know where to find people who share similar interests and have the same vision. Even then, people who happen to be in groups feel like they are stuck or stagnating as artists: they don’t know what the next step is. The process of moving from noodling in jam sessions to recording in the studio or performing at gigs is may present a significant challenge. There is plenty of latent potential that is locked away and, as a result, hundreds of songs and musical project not being made.

## Our Solution
Harmonee’s mission is to unlock this potential, making the logistics of band formation and maintenance from something that is a burden into something that is exciting and painless. Our use of a mobile app format lead to the two tasks we found most important: establishing a network of musicians, and thoughtful preparation for events.
