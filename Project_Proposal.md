### Status Quo
With the plethora of online teaching programs, it is undeniable that now is the easiest time in history to learn an instrument. Sites like Ultimate Guitar exist to provide guitarists and bassist with tablature to learn songs, and online communities like YouTube connect aspiring musicians with music teachers through video-chat lessons and recorded tutorials. With these resources, musicians can get pretty far in their individual musical development, however there currently lacks an established method for connecting musicians for the purposes of physically playing together. Online teaching methods can certainly make a musician competent with oneâ€™s own instrument, but for people who want to play with others, this is just half of the story. Having two musicians who are comfortable with their respective instruments may not always be enough if they cannot effectively read each other and make in-the-moment decisions based off of those readings. There is no substitute to playing with other musicians if one wishes to become competent playing in a band or other musical group.

### Filling the gap with Mulliance
Through Mulliance, we hope to bridge the interpersonal gap in online music training. We hope to connect musicians of all skill levels with other musicians in their area, and facilitate the process of physically playing with other people. We want to take away the stress and awkwardness of finding players on your own, and provide logistic solutions for coordinating jam or practice sessions. This may be in the form of creating an online community to match musicians with others based on location, skill, musical interest, as well as any other relevant metrics. The Mulliance platform may also include other services to facilitate practice sessions, such as providing our community with a digital space to rent instruments or practice spaces from other users. Implementation details aside, the goal of Mulliance is to allow musicians to develop the skills needed to perform with people.
