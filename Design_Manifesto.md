### We’re all a bit egocentric, but there’s still hope.
  With every step of designing Harmonee, five enduring principles always seemed to find a way to come up and slap us in the face. The first principle, that perhaps fuels all the rest, is the idea that at the beginning of any project, you’re going to have some egocentric tendencies. Our own perspectives and knowledge are of course our defaults. They are immediately available to us in a way that no other perspectives can ever be. All throughout the design process, droplets of egocentrism bleed over our work, with every assumption we make. With Harmonee, this is true from the very conception of our project proposal. In reality, an idea for a platform such as Harmonee, starts with the grand assumption that people want or need an application to match musicians, and manage bands simply because we, the creators, want it. Before any real research was done (ie interviews and contextual inquiries) to validate or invalidate this assumption, the idea was simply that: an assumption that this idea would in some way benefit others because it benefits us. At this stage of the project, we were left with only one responsible course of action that would help to ameliorate Harmonee’s egocentric conception. Cold hard facts. Data. Real experiences. Actual perspectives. We needed to conduct user research in order to bring in a source of objectivity.

### Objectivity might be impossible, but it’s still worth chasing.  
  The primary way we chose to conduct our research was through a combination of contextual inquiries and semi-structured interviews. The idea of conducting contextual inquiries is to go through the actual motions of a task relating to our project with someone who actively performs this task. WIth contextual inquiries, researchers sit down with this person as they perform every step needed to complete the task. We request that our subjects talk through the “why” of every step, while we continuously ask questions with the intention of finding existing problems with the process that could be addressed by our design. There is also an emphasis on adhering to a master/apprentice relationship, where the researcher makes it clear that they are there to learn from their valuable insights. I suggest that anyone wanting to know more about contextual inquiries read chapter three of [Contextual Design by Beyer and Holtzblatt](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fglow.williams.edu%2Fcourses%2F2539542%2Ffiles%2Ffolder%2Freadings%3Fpreview%3D153992307&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHzYEhhDiXE8sxOVoX7pjGx5esUDA).
  
This method definitely helped us to bring in some objectivity via gathering more experiences of the problem spaces. However, we found that it was still very easy for our own biases that emerge from our initial egocentric mindset to taint our perception of the data. We found that qualitative research in this manor allowed us to sometimes unintentionally lead our interviewees to aspects of our tasks that we already had preconceived notions about. For example, we had already identified the problem of difficulty in finding and approaching band members from our personal experiences before research started, so I think there might have been a bias in the amount of questions asked about this specific aspect of our app. It should be noted that despite possible bias here, we found that all interviewees mentioned acute issues with this aspect of band formation. I imagine that without this questioning bias, we still would have identified this issue, but perhaps we might have focused on other aspects that could have been brought up or focused on within this time. I think that bias is an issue that is bound to come up in any research that is qualitative in nature, but there is still a lot we can learn despite this.

### Accessibility actually doesn’t just help those who absolutely need it.
  After all our initial research on the problem space was done, it came time to start creating tangible mockups of the Harmonee interface. While we tried to make our designs reflect the observations made from our previous research and interviewee, the iterative process quickly showed that we were not yet free of assumptions and egocentric tendencies. This was to be expected to an extent, as we knew going into our [paper](https://project-harmonee.github.io/2019-10-30-Paper-Prototype/) and [digital](https://project-harmonee.github.io/2019-11-13-Digital-Mockup/) prototypes with the premise that they will not be perfect at first, and require testing. However, an interesting observation was that many of our oversights resulted in “fixes” that made the application more accessible for individuals who are disabled or otherwise different in capability from the average person. More than anything else, I think this was the iterative design process telling us that we had not been thinking enough about accessibility and people who are different from us. I think this is true, as unfortunately none of our usability tests included individuals whom we would reasonably expect to have issues with accessibility. Many of the changes we had to make because of complaints from our user testing actually correspond to many of the “Do’s” in the article, [Dos and don'ts of designing for accessibility](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fglow.williams.edu%2Ffiles%2F153992322%2Fdownload%3Fdownload_frd%3D1&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGGu6gSbxze0CXtz5BR5Cuf5QV_cw). For example, one of the biggest issues identified within our user tests was that for the profile creation page, it was unclear when they have completed their profile, and when Harmonee has started to look for band matches.

  If we had thought more about accessibility, perhaps this wouldn’t have been an issue, as this was a specific point in the article about designing for people with anxiety: “Don’t leave users confused about next steps or timeframes.” While I always think that thinking about accessibility just for the sake of including people who may not be as able, I think this experience taught us the lesson that thinking about accessibility helps everyone, even users who you would not expect to have problems with accessibility.

### Keep it simple, stupid. 
  While fighting our egocentrism remains an enduring problem in our design process, I think that something we were able to do particularly well throughout is keeping our designs relatively simple. I think that our digital prototype is a good example of this ideal, as we were able to simplify our messages  There are still definitely moments where we 

### Worship strangers, abandon your children.
  In order to fight the ever present influences of egocentrism in our design, we needed people to research our initial problem space, as well as people to test our designs iteration after iteration. This part can not be understated. By the time we had drafted our first paper prototype, which you can see below, we had spent hours and hours crafting our platform to the point where a sort of “blinding” attachment was bound to form. In other words, we were unfit to judge our own “children” and thus needed outside impartial help to improve meaningfully. With this observation of our reliance on people as a resource, it was especially important for us to take particular ethical considerations. For example, the nature of the usability tests are such that our users may not be able to complete the assigned tasks, and that might cause discomfort or frustration. To mitigate any potential harm, we followed several of the ethical principles set by Carolyn Snyder in chapter eight of Paper Prototyping. More specifically, we started every session with the premise that their performance is not under evaluation, but rather the quality of our prototype, so that any inability to complete a task reflects a shortcoming of Harmonee, never them. In addition, while we could not pay our “strangers” we made it clear to them that they are providing us with a great service. Lastly, we always made sure to let our testers know that they are in control, so they can simply stop the evaluations at any point should they feel uncomfortable. You can find more detailed information on how we conducted evaluations [here](https://project-harmonee.github.io/2019-11-10-Usability-Testing-Review/).
