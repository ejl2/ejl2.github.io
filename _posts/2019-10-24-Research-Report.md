title: Learning Music From Collaboration: Research Report

   The research article, Learning Music From Collaboration, by R. Keith Sawyer, borrows from several empirical studies to attempt to determine “the relationship between group collaboration and individual learning” (Sawyer, 2008, p. 50). This article mainly takes findings from the disciplines of jazz and theatre improvisation to show how collaborative skills are developed to the point where individuals can begin combining their expertise to create something greater than the sum of its parts. From the beginning of the article, the Sawyer points out how individual mastery of an instrument rarely translates immediately to competency playing with other musicians in a coherent manner. Playing competently with others requires a whole set of unwritten social and technical rules idiomatic to the genre of music being played, as well as the “domains” of the discipline that indicate individual mastery and understanding of a piece of music as it is being played. Sawyer describes the tradition of “sharing fours” or “sharing eights” as an example of this shared knowledge, where musicians will play a solo for exactly four or eight meausures, and then pass the solo to another musician, with the expectation that the other musicians will not only bring their own musical ideas, but also stay reasonably within the constraints of the previous idea. In this way, Sawyer maintains the importance of approaching jam sessions or collaborative music as a conversation of sorts where one is expected to follow the “yes, and” rule where ideas from one musician are not thrown away, but developed into consonant but not identical phrases.
   Sawyer maintains towards the end of his piece that competency in playing collaboratively is only achieved through countless jam sessions and other types of performative social interactions with other musicians. This should be a major component in the process of learning music, however, there appears to be a great lack in this area, as music education is often distinctly individual. 
I personally agree with the points that Sawyer makes, especially those about the existence of unwritten rules and domains within music that are not typically learned through a traditional, individual centered musical education. I can only speak from the limited anecdotal experience of provided myself and a few musical peers, but I can say that a lot of what Sawyer has to say about unexpected social rules are typical and sometimes frustrating sentiments of people just starting playing music with others.

   After reading this article, I think that there are some extra considerations I could have had when generating our tasks. Specifically, I think I would have focussed more on the task of supporting learning collaborative music skills. In our current design, we partially acknowledge this by offering users the opportunity to join jam sessions, but it might have been interesting to support a function within our app that aims to educate users of the basics of collaborative music in their specific genre (ex: sharing fours in jazz music) prior to engaging in person. Despite potentially missing out on this idea, I do think that our design does a pretty good job of acknowledging one of the key points of this piece: 
   “Musicians cannot learn jazz simply from books at home; before attaining competence, an aspiring musician must attend 
    uncountable jam sessions, and probably has played in many different beginner bands” (Sawyer, 2008, p. 56).
Our task of building a musical network attempts to provide musicians with an opportunity to build competency through participation in jam sessions.
