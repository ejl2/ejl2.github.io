title: The Lying (or at best misleading) Mattress

During the first few days on campus before starting class, I had a rather amusing conversation with my suitemate. He was frustrated at the time about having been misled by his mattress after finally arriving to campus following a long and tiring flight from California. 

When he first got back to his room, all he wanted to do was rest his head. So he went through the process of preparing his bed for a nap. Much to his excitement, he saw that the mattress had a sticker on it that read “Plush Firm Side”. Clearly this meant that he could flip the mattress over to get a softer mattress! Pleased with his discovery, my friend proceeds to go through the work of lifting and rotating the mattress, only to find that the reverse side reads “Extra Firm Side”. Feeling utterly betrayed by the one thing that was supposed to bring him comfort after his long day, my friend had to once again go through the trouble of lifting and flipping his mattress.

The design was insufficient here because the signifier (sticker label) failed to effectively convey the fact that the opposite side of the mattress was indeed firmer than the current side. As we can see from the previous case study, this can result in the intended user (a weary college student orienting their bed at the start of the school year) wasting much time and energy.
