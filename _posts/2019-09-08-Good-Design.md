Arguably overlooked appliances that I appreciate as examples of good design are the light switches in Bryant residence hall dorms. Above are three examples of light switches in the dorm. There is absolutely nothing particularly noteworthy about these switches. Each one turns a light in the room “on” when they are switched up, and “off” when they are switched down. When I moved in, I spent a good amount of time inspecting my room and all its features, like the overly complicated window crank mechanism, and the misleading mattress labels. The switch however, was given almost no attention at all. I believe this to be indicative of good design. I was able to walk in, flip on the lights and continue on without skipping a beat!

There are several properties of the switches that make the user experience (successfully) unnoteworthy. The first is the placement of the switch. For all rooms, the switch is located on the wall adjacent to the entrance that is opposite the side of the door hinges. This is a small detail that is true for all rooms, which makes me believe it was a conscious design decision. All the doors open inwards, so if the switch were on the other wall adjacent to the entrance, it would be covered by the door when opened. This is a scenario that would undoubtedly annoy most students as they return from a late night of studying at Schow.

The second property that I believe makes this a good design example is the fact that the switch mechanism is very well known and essentially universal. While a typical traditional light switch does not come with signifiers that imply the affordance of the device, the fact that it is so well known makes it a good choice for this situation. Most people live within a context in which people just know how to use a traditional light switch because they are so common!
